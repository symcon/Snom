# Snom (Deskphone) Symcon module
## Description

This module is part of the [Snom Symcon library](https://github.com/symcon/Snom/tree/main).  
After configurating an instance of this module, the user of the Snom deskphone can control and visualize end devices of an automation system integrated in IP-Symcon.  

Pressing a function key of the Deskphone the user can, for example, control the lights, doors or blinds of a KNX system.  
The LEDS of the function keys can be used for visualizing the status of the different parts of a facility, for example, an LED on the phone turns red if an alarm is triggered.  

## Installing through the Module Store
Before being able to use the Snom module, it needs to be installed through the [Module Store](https://www.symcon.de/en/service/documentation/components/management-console/module-store/). The module can be found by searching for "Snom".
