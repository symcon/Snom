# Snom (Deskphone) Symcon module
## Description

This module is part of the [Snom Symcon library](https://github.com/symcon/Snom/tree/main).  
After configurating an instance of this module, the user of the Snom deskphone can control and visualize end devices of an automation system integrated in IP-Symcon.  

Pressing a function key of the Deskphone the user can, for example, control the lights, doors or blinds of a KNX system.  
The LEDS of the function keys can be used for visualizing the status of the different parts of a facility, for example, an LED on the phone turns red if an alarm is triggered.  

It is also possible to trigger actions in the facility, when an event in the phone happens (e.g. switch on a light when an incoming call happens and switch it of when the user picks up the phone handset).  
[These are the possible phone events](https://service.snom.com/display/wiki/Action+URLs#ActionURLs-Events).
